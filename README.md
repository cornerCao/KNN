# KNN algorithm
just for practice :)
written by python
code.py is KNN algorithm
classfy by KNN.py is using KNN to classify the letter data from UCI, but the result is not satisfactory. I have tested 10000 letters' data and the accuracy is 32.68%. And then I calculated the distance between the center of different letters and the distance is not far away, so KNN is not a good method in this case and I will try another method.
